        "criticalAlert": "As of early 2026, visitor numbers have hit record highs (40M+ annually). If arriving via the HZMB Bridge at peak times, expect 45+ minute wait times for taxis. Head straight for the **Casino Shuttle** or **Public Bus 101X/102X** lines instead.",

          "**Macau Pass:** If staying more than 2 days, buy a Macau Pass (MOP 130). It halves the cost of bus/LRT fares and works at 7-Eleven and Vending Machines.",
