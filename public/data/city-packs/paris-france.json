        "description": "Paris transport has undergone a massive modernization. The 2024 Olympic legacy remains, most notably the direct rail links to Orly which have replaced older, slower bus routes.",
        "criticalAlert": "The **Entry/Exit System (EES)** is now active for all non-EU travelers. Expect 15–30 minute delays at immigration for biometric registration (fingerprints/photo) on your first entry into the Schengen Area.",

          "**Metro 14 (Orly):** Forget the OrlyBus. Take Metro Line 14 directly to Châtelet or Gare de Lyon. It’s fully automated, runs every 2 minutes, and costs only €14 (or is included in a Navigo pass).",
          "**RER B (CDG):** This remains the fastest way into town from CDG, but it is notorious for strikes and pickpockets. If you have heavy luggage, consider a flat-rate taxi or an app like G7.",
          "**RoissyBus Warning:** As of March 2026, the RoissyBus from CDG to Opéra is being phased out. Check the RATP app for the latest bus alternatives or stick to the RER B.",
          "**ETIAS:** If you are visiting in late 2026, check if the **ETIAS** (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) has officially launched. It will require a €7 pre-travel digital authorization."

          "**Validation:** You MUST validate your ticket/phone at every entry. Inspecting 'contrôleurs' are frequent on the Metro, and they do not accept 'I didn't know' as an excuse for an unvalidated ride (fines start at €50).",
