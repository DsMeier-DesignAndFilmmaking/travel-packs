          "**Terminal Transfer:** Transfers between T2/T3, T4, and T5 are free via the trains, but you must still tap a contactless card or Oyster (you won't be charged)."

          "**Foreign Fees:** Check if your bank charges 'Foreign Transaction Fees.' If they do, an Oyster card might actually be cheaper to avoid 20+ small transaction fees daily.",
          "**Weekly Cap:** If you arrive on a Monday, London's weekly cap (Monday–Sunday) offers the best value for long stays.",
          "**Tipping:** A 12.5% 'Service Charge' is usually added to restaurant bills. You do not need to tip extra unless the service was exceptional."
